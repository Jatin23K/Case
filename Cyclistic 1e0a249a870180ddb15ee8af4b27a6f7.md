## **📂 PROCESS PHASE: Data Cleaning & Integrity**

📌 **1. Merging Monthly Data**

- The **12 months of trip data** were combined into a single table using SQL (`UNION ALL`).

📌 **2. Handling Missing Data**

- **`end_station_name` and `end_station_id`** had missing values, which were replaced with `"Unknown"` to maintain consistency.
- **NULL timestamps** (`started_at`, `ended_at`) were removed to avoid calculation errors.

📌 **3. Creating a New Column (`ride_length`)**

- Calculated the **difference between ride start and ride end times** to determine the duration of each trip.

📌 **4. Removing Outliers**

- **Negative ride lengths** (likely data errors) were removed.
- **Unrealistic ride durations (>24 hours)** were excluded to avoid skewing analysis.

📌 **5. Data Integrity Check**

- Verified ride distributions by **membership type**, **day of the week**, and **ride duration** to confirm data consistency before analysis.
